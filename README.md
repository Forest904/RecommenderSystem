CROSS-RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM



The algorithm builds a content-based recommender system that suggests similar books and movies based on textual features like authors, descriptions, and categories. It preprocesses the data, uses LM BERT for text vectorization, and calculates cosine similarities to find similar items. The system is evaluated using standard metrics to validate its performance, and it provides recommendations for a given content title, displaying the results with the content type for clarity
